The program computes the perimeter of a polygon. It begins by reading the x
and y values for the first point on the perimeter of the polygon from the user. Then
continues reading pairs of x and y values until the user enters a blank line for the
x-coordinate. Each time it reads an additional coordinate it computes the
distance to the previous point and adds it to the perimeter. When a blank line is entered
for the x-coordinate program adds the distance from the last point back
to the first point to the perimeter. Then it displays the total perimeter. Sample
input and output is shown below, with user input:

Enter the x part of the coordinate: 0

Enter the y part of the coordinate: 0


Enter the x part of the coordinate: (blank to quit): 1

Enter the y part of the coordinate: 0


Enter the x part of the coordinate: (blank to quit): 0

Enter the y part of the coordinate: 1


Enter the x part of the coordinate: (blank to quit):


The perimeter of that polygon is 3.414213562373095

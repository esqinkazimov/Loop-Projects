What’s the minimum number of times you have to flip a coin before you can have
three consecutive flips that result in the same outcome (either all three are heads or
all three are tails)? What’s the maximum number of flips that might be needed? How
many flips are needed on average? In this project I explored these questions
by creating a program that simulates several series of coin flips.

The program that uses Python’s random number generator to simulate flipping
a coin several times. The simulated coin should be fair, meaning that the probability
of heads is equal to the probability of tails. The program flips simulated
coins until either 3 consecutive heads or 3 consecutive tails occur. It displays an H each
time the outcome is heads, and a T each time the outcome is tails, with all of the
outcomes shown on the same line. Then displays the number of flips needed to reach
3 consecutive flips with the same outcome. When program is run it should
perform the simulation as many as the user wants and reports the average number of flips needed.

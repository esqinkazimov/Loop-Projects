A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”,
“civic”, “level”, “hannah", “go dog”, “flee to me remote elf” and “some men interpret nine memos”
are all examples of palindromic words.

The program reads a statement from the user and uses a loop to 
determine whether or not it is a palindrome. It ignores the signs, 
capital letters and spaces. Then it displays the result, including a meaningful 
output message.

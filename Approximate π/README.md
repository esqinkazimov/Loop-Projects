The value of π can be approximated by the following infinite series:

π ≈ 3 + 4/(2 × 3 × 4) − 4/(4 × 5 × 6) + 4/(6 × 7 × 8) − 4/(8 × 9 × 10) + 4/(10 × 11 × 12) − ···

The program displays the number of approximations of π entered by the user. The first approximation
makes use of only the first term from the infinite series. Each additional approximation displayed 
by program includes one more term in the series, making it a better approximation of π than any of 
the approximations displayed previously.

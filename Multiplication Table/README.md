The program displays a multiplication table that shows the 
products of all combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up 
to and including 10 times 10. Multiplication table includes
a row of labels across the top of it containing the numbers 
1 through 10. It also includes labels down the left side consisting 
of the numbers 1 through 10.
  
When completing this project I found it helpful to be able to
print out a value without moving down to the next line. This can be accomplished
by addin end="" as the last parameter to print statement. For example,
print("A") will display the letter A and then move down to the next line. The
statement print("A", end="") will display the letter A without moving down
to the next line, causing the next print statement to display its result on the same line
as the letter A.
